# Gold Price Forecasting using Multiple Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** to forecast **Gold Prices** using historical data from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains real-world gold price records along with influencing factors such as currency exchange rates, stock indices, and commodity prices.  

The project is designed as a **template**:  
- You can easily replace the dataset (`.csv` file) with any other time-series or financial dataset.  
- The code automatically adapts to the new file, provided the dataset has numerical features suitable for regression.

## ⚙️ Features
- Clean and modular code for forecasting gold prices.
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling).
- Model training and evaluation using metrics like **R² Score**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
- Template-style structure: just change the CSV filename to apply the model to a new dataset.
